# Art Engine

### Under development: for more documentation, see the   readme.md

### GitHub Generator Repo: [https://github.com/nftchef/hashlips\_art\_engine/tree/nested-folder-structure](https://github.com/nftchef/hashlips\_art\_engine/tree/nested-folder-structure)

This art engine is based on and continues to use the interface and setup from the Hashlips Art Engine.&#x20;

This art generator (art engine) has a number of advanced features to help build more complicated sets of generated art from transparent .png trait layers. The core feature is to support branching generation (illustrated below) using nested folders to control the if/then flow of how the generator chooses each layer.

This generator is only for static images.&#x20;
